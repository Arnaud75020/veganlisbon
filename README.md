# Vegan Lisbon
A three-days group project developed remotely during the Web Development course at *Wild Code School - Lisbon* by **Arnaud Duhé**, **Fernanda Abbud**, **Filipa Marta**.

## The Idea
Our idea was to make a digital platform for vegan & vegetarian culture in the portuguese capital, Lisbon. We focused on having the best spots in town for food, drinks and shopping, where users could rate their favourite ones. We also had a reserved space for events, always related to the vegan and vegetarian lifestyle.
We named our project: **Vegan Lisbon**.

## The Development
We brainstormed around the idea of what special thing Lisbon would have to offer and **Vegan Lisbon** came into life, our project. We draw wireframes to organise our ideas, add features and connect the pages. There were six pages in total: Homepage, About, Contact for restaurants, Contact for users, a Category page (Food, in this case) and the Detail page (one restaurant detailed). We setup the GitHub environment using Git, created branches and split work among ourselves. Mostly we used Visual Code Studio to write the code - HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap - and for visual interface design - Sketch. To prepare the presentation we used Google Slides. Everything in this project was made remotely through Google Hangouts meetings. 

## Our Role
We worked together on the brainstorm, wireframes, setup the GitHub and Trello environment. We split the coding part between pages and Arnaud Duhé worked on the Homepage and About pages, as well as in the Footer, which was a common feature. Fernanda Abbud worked on the two Contact pages (one only for restaurants and other for users). Filipa Marta worked on the Category page (Food, in this case) and the Detail page (one restaurant detailed), a common feature - the menu bar. Webdesign of the website was managed by Filipa. We worked a lot all together remotely, taking doubts, discussing ideas and being there to one another when Git came into stage. Fernanda and Filipa worked on the presentation layouts and Arnaud setup GitHub Pages of the project. Together we presented our project to our colleagues on March 27th, 2020.
